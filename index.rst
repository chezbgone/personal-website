I am an incoming Master's student at MIT studying math and CS, especially
things in their intersection, like functional programming, category theory,
and type theory. Currently, I am working on formal verification of TODO

Other things that I'm interested in are
linguistics,
LaTeX,
singing,
video games,
`customizing my computer <https://github.com/chezbgone/dotfiles>`_,
(Neo)vim, and
Arch Linux.

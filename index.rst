I am a Master's student at MIT
advised by `Adam Chlipala <http://adam.chlipala.net/>`_.
My research interests broadly revolve around programming languages,
especially things in the intersection of math and computer science,
like functional programming, type theory, logic, and category theory.

Other things that I'm interested in are
linguistics,
LaTeX,
singing,
video games,
`customizing my computer <https://github.com/chezbgone/dotfiles>`_,
(Neo)vim, and
Arch Linux.

  I'm a software engineer that recently graduated from MIT. My academic interests broadly revolve
  around math and computer science, with programming languages as a special interest. This include
  several topics like functional programming, type theory, logic, and category theory.

  Some other things I'm interested in are typesetting, video games, linguistics, <a
